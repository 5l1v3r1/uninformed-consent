# (Un)informed Consent: Studying GDPR Consent Notices in the Field
Supporting material to the CCS 2019 paper, "(Un)informed Consent: Studying GDPR Consent Notices in the Field".

*Last update: November 11, 2019*

# Errata

After the camera-ready deadline of ACM CCS 2019, we noticed an error in the figures depicting the interaction rates with the consent notices (Figures X--Y in the paper). This does not affect the overall results of our experiments.
We fixed this and uploaded the updated version of the paper to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.02638.pdf) and the [Ruhr University Bochum website](https://www.syssec.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/emma/veroeffentlichungen/2019/10/22/uninformedconsent.pdf).

# Notices

This section depicts all of the consent notices / conditions tested in Experiments 1--3.
Note that the text of the notices was translated to English from the German originals.

## Experiment 1: Position

In Experiment 1, the following notice (referred to as BIN-S1 in Appendix B) was displayed at the six positions shown below.
